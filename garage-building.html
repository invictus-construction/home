    <h2>Garage & Car Port Construction — What to expect</h2>
    <p>Invictus Construction builds durable, code-compliant garages and car ports for Sarnia homeowners. We manage the entire process — foundation and drainage, structural framing, roofing, siding, insulation, and final finishes — using structural-grade lumber, premium fasteners, and roofing materials rated for our local climate.</p>

    <h3>Quality materials & workmanship</h3>
    <p>We use industry trusted materials: concrete mixes suited for slab loads and drainage, engineered lumber and metal connectors, weather-rated siding and high-quality roofing products. Every step is inspected before moving on to the next phase so workmanship is consistent and durable.</p>

    <h3>Step-by-step process</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Initial consultation & site assessment — measurements, drainage plan and design options.</li>
      <li>Design & approval — choose layout, overhead doors, windows, and finishes.</li>
      <li>Permits & scheduling — we obtain required permits and plan the build phases.</li>
      <li>Foundation & concrete work — form, pour and cure to ensure long-term strength.</li>
      <li>Framing & sheathing — structural framing installed by experienced crews.</li>
      <li>Roofing & exterior finishes — weatherproofing, siding, and roofing completed to code.</li>
      <li>Interior finishing & handover — wiring, doors, hardware and final inspection.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Client flexibility & choices</h3>
    <p>You decide the layout, door systems, insulation level and finishes. We provide material samples and recommendations — from garage door styles to interior flooring and shelving options — and update the timeline and budget as choices are finalized.</p>
